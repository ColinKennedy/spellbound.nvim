I have coworkers who speak English as a second or even third language. To make my docstrings and documentation easier to understand, I added a restriction - "You may only use 1000 unique words" and made myself a list. Still, even though I made that list, I accidentally would still write words like "detected" instead of "found", "generate" instead of "create", "extract" instead of "get", etc. Old habits die hard.

spellbound.nvim exists in order to:

- Help point out hard words and suggest easier words instead
- Jump to these suggested words easily
- View suggestions entire projects

A nice side effect of this plugin - if docstrings are easier for second/third English speakers, chances are its even easier to read for native speakers too.

I have a setup that works well but spellbound.nvim is an attempt to make a generic plugin
that others can use. If you try this out, please let me know how it goes for you. Thanks!
